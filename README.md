REST APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs) and RESTful APIs are two related terms used to describe web services that adhere to the principles of REST architecture..

REST API (Representational State Transfer API):

REST API is a type of web service that follows the principles of REST architecture.
It is an architectural style for designing networked applications, especially web services.

+ REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and each resource can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML) based on client requirements.
REST APIs use stateless communication, meaning each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.
REST APIs are widely used due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration.
RESTful API:

+ The term "RESTful" is used to describe APIs that adhere to the principles of REST.
A RESTful API is a web service that is designed and implemented based on the REST architecture.
It means the API follows the guidelines and best practices of REST, including using HTTP methods, using meaningful and hierarchical resource URLs, using standard HTTP status codes, etc.
RESTful APIs are meant to be easy to understand, use, and interact with since they follow standardized conventions for communication.
In summary, REST API is a generic term referring to any web service that follows the REST architectural principles. On the other hand, RESTful API specifically refers to a web service that strictly adheres to these principles, making it easy for developers to interact with the API and follow standardized communication patterns. RESTful APIs are a subset of REST APIs.
